**NPSNAV.in** is a website that tracks the **Latest NAV and Historical Performance of NPS Funds** in India. It provides up-to-date insights into the National Pension Scheme (NPS) fund performances, including the latest Net Asset Value (NAV) and historical returns, with an easy-to-use API for Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and other financial planning tools.

## Features

- Displays all NPS funds with their latest NAV and performance data.
- Provides historical returns for each fund over different timeframes.
- Data is fetched directly from Protean eGov Technologies Limited (formerly NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Limited).
- Each fund has its own dedicated page with detailed performance data.
- A **FREE API** provides easy access to the latest NPS fund NAVs, with the API returning the latest NAV as plain text.
- The project's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are minified for optimized performance.

## API Usage

Easily integrate real-time and historical NAV data for any NPS fund with our API. Three types of APIs are currently available:

### Simple API
Fetch the latest NAV of any NPS fund using its scheme code.
  ```
  https://npsnav.in/api/{scheme_code}
  ```
The API will return the NAV value as plain text.

### Detailed API

Get detailed information about an NPS fund, including returns over various timeframes.

```
https://npsnav.in/api/detailed/{scheme_code}
```
